Functional demo with Spring Boot and Apache Kafka

> Note: this project uses the Confluent Docker image to avoid installing Apache Kafka locally.

## Todo

- [x] Use KRaft instead of Zookeeper 
- [x] Add UI
- [ ] Add Retry + DLT
- [ ] Run the proejct via mvn commands

## Notable features

1. **Modular architecture** – Producer and consumer are separate, following single responsibility principle.

2. **Dependency Injection** – Kafka beans and services are injected via Spring for clean, testable code.

4. **Asynchronous Kafka producer with callbacks** – Logs success and errors efficiently without blocking.

4. **Error handling for consumers** – ErrorHandlingDeserializer prevents malformed messages from crashing the service.

5. **Concurrent message processing** – Consumers can process multiple messages in parallel for scalability.

6. **Programmatic topic creation** – Topics are defined in code using NewTopic and TopicBuilder.

## How to use it



40s demo (literal)

From the project root:


1. **Start Kafka (docker)**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
2. **Build and run**:
   ```
   Run Main from the modules:

   - Producer

   - Consumer
   ```
3. **Send a test message**:

   Post request to: `http://localhost:8084/event`

   body: `(raw)`

   ```
   {
    "transactionID": 1,
    "event": "WITHDRAW",
    "amount": 100.0,
    "status": "SUBMITTED"
   }
   ```
